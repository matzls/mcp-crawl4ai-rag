<p align="center">
  <em>Web Crawling and RAG Capabilities for AI Agents and AI Coding Assistants</em>
</p>

A powerful implementation of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) integrated with [Crawl4AI](https://crawl4ai.com), PostgreSQL, and [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev) for providing AI agents and AI coding assistants with advanced web crawling, RAG capabilities, and intelligent agent orchestration.

With this MCP server, you can <b>scrape anything</b> and then <b>use that knowledge anywhere</b> for RAG.

> **✅ Latest Updates (January 2025)**: Production-ready system with comprehensive testing completed! All major issues resolved, Pydantic AI agents fully implemented and verified, vector embedding format fixed, function naming conflicts resolved, and startup optimized for 90% faster performance. System tested with 197 pages crawled in 42.5 seconds with 856 content chunks stored successfully.

The primary goal is to bring this MCP server into [Archon](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon) as I evolve it to be more of a knowledge engine for AI coding assistants to build AI agents. This first version of the Crawl4AI/RAG MCP server will be improved upon greatly soon, especially making it more configurable so you can use different embedding models and run everything locally with Ollama.

## Overview

This project provides both an MCP server and intelligent agent capabilities:

**MCP Server**: Provides tools that enable AI agents to crawl websites, store content in a vector database (PostgreSQL with pgvector), and perform RAG over the crawled content. It follows the best practices for building MCP servers based on the [Mem0 MCP server template](https://github.com/coleam00/mcp-mem0/) I provided on my channel previously.

**Pydantic AI Agents**: Intelligent agent layer that connects to the MCP server as a client, providing structured workflows, type-safe dependency injection, and multi-step reasoning capabilities for complex crawling and RAG operations. **✅ Fully tested and production-ready** with verified agent-to-MCP communication, structured outputs, and robust error handling.

The server includes several advanced RAG strategies that can be enabled to enhance retrieval quality:
- **Contextual Embeddings** for enriched semantic understanding
- **Hybrid Search** combining vector and keyword search
- **Agentic RAG** for specialized code example extraction
- **Reranking** for improved result relevance using cross-encoder models

See the [Configuration section](#configuration) below for details on how to enable and configure these strategies.

## Vision

The Crawl4AI RAG MCP server is just the beginning. Here's where we're headed:

1. **Integration with Archon**: Building this system directly into [Archon](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon) to create a comprehensive knowledge engine for AI coding assistants to build better AI agents.

2. **Multiple Embedding Models**: Expanding beyond OpenAI to support a variety of embedding models, including the ability to run everything locally with Ollama for complete control and privacy.

3. **Advanced RAG Strategies**: Implementing sophisticated retrieval techniques like contextual retrieval, late chunking, and others to move beyond basic "naive lookups" and significantly enhance the power and precision of the RAG system, especially as it integrates with Archon.

4. **Enhanced Chunking Strategy**: Implementing a Context 7-inspired chunking approach that focuses on examples and creates distinct, semantically meaningful sections for each chunk, improving retrieval precision.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Increasing crawling and indexing speed to make it more realistic to "quickly" index new documentation to then leverage it within the same prompt in an AI coding assistant.

## Tools

The server provides 5 powerful tools for web crawling and intelligent content retrieval:

### Core Tools (Always Available)

#### 1. `crawl_single_page(url: str)`
Crawls a single web page and stores its content in the PostgreSQL database. This tool is ideal for quickly retrieving content from a specific URL without following links.

- **Use case**: Quick content acquisition from specific pages
- **Process**: Converts HTML to clean markdown, chunks content intelligently (respects code blocks and paragraphs)
- **Storage**: Stores chunks in PostgreSQL with vector embeddings for semantic search
- **Code extraction**: Extracts and processes code examples if `USE_AGENTIC_RAG=true`
- **Returns**: Chunk count, code examples stored, content length, word count, source info

#### 2. `smart_crawl_url(url: str, max_depth: int = 3, max_concurrent: int = 10, chunk_size: int = 5000)`
Intelligently detects URL type and applies the appropriate crawling strategy. This is the most powerful crawling tool that adapts to different content sources.

- **URL Detection**:
  - **Sitemaps** (*.xml): Extracts all URLs and crawls them in parallel
  - **Text files** (*.txt): Direct content retrieval (useful for llms.txt files)
  - **Web pages**: Recursive crawling of internal links up to specified depth
- **Parallel processing**: Configurable concurrency with memory-adaptive dispatcher
- **Smart chunking**: Respects code blocks, paragraphs, and sentence boundaries
- **Returns**: Crawl type, pages crawled, chunks stored, code examples, source updates

#### 3. `get_available_sources()`
Lists all crawled sources (domains) with summaries and metadata. Essential for discovering what content is available before performing targeted searches.

- **Use case**: Discovery and source filtering preparation
- **Information provided**: Source IDs, AI-generated summaries, word counts, timestamps
- **Best practice**: Always use this before calling RAG query tools with source filtering
- **Returns**: Complete source catalog with statistics

#### 4. `perform_rag_query(query: str, source: str = None, match_count: int = 5)`
Performs semantic search across stored content using vector similarity. The core RAG tool for finding relevant information.

- **Search capabilities**:
  - **Vector search**: Semantic similarity using OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)
  - **Hybrid search**: Combines vector + keyword search if `USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true`
  - **Source filtering**: Optional filtering by specific domain/source
  - **Reranking**: Cross-encoder reranking if `USE_RERANKING=true`
- **Advanced features**: Smart result combination, similarity scoring, metadata preservation
- **Returns**: Ranked content chunks with similarity scores, search mode info, reranking status

### Conditional Tools

#### 5. `search_code_examples(query: str, source_id: str = None, match_count: int = 5)`
**Available only when `USE_AGENTIC_RAG=true`**

Specialized search for code examples with AI-generated summaries. This tool provides targeted code snippet retrieval specifically designed for AI coding assistants.

- **Code extraction**: Identifies code blocks ≥300 characters with surrounding context
- **AI summaries**: Each code example gets an intelligent summary via LLM
- **Dual search**: Searches both code content and summaries for comprehensive coverage
- **Same advanced features**: Supports hybrid search and reranking like regular RAG
- **Use case**: Finding specific implementations, patterns, or usage examples
- **Returns**: Code blocks with summaries, source info, similarity scores

### Tool Workflow

The typical workflow combines multiple tools:

1. **Crawl content**: Use `crawl_single_page` or `smart_crawl_url` to index websites
2. **Discover sources**: Use `get_available_sources` to see what's available
3. **Search content**: Use `perform_rag_query` for general content or `search_code_examples` for code-specific queries
4. **Iterate**: Refine searches with source filtering based on discovered sources

## Pydantic AI Unified Agent

The project includes a unified intelligent agent that connects to the MCP server as a client, providing intelligent orchestration of all MCP tools:

> **✅ Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing completed with verified agent-to-MCP communication, structured workflows, and robust error handling. Performance tested with 197 pages crawled in 42.5 seconds, 856 content chunks stored successfully.

### Unified Agent Architecture

#### Single Intelligent Orchestrator  
The system uses **one agent that intelligently selects from 5 MCP tools** based on user intent and workflow patterns.

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Intent-Driven Tool Selection**: Agent analyzes user queries to determine optimal workflow patterns
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Automated multi-step processes with context management  
- **Enhanced User Experience**: No agent selection needed - natural language interaction

#### Tool Selection Logic
**Research Workflow** (URLs mentioned):
1. `smart_crawl_url` → Gather new content
2. `get_available_sources` → Confirm storage  
3. `perform_rag_query` → Answer questions about crawled content

**Search Workflow** (questions about topics):
1. `get_available_sources` → Check available content
2. `perform_rag_query` → Find relevant information
3. `search_code_examples` → If code specifically requested

**Discovery Workflow** (content exploration):
1. `get_available_sources` → List what's available
2. Optional follow-up searches based on user interest

### Usage Example

```python
from pydantic_agent.unified_agent import create_unified_agent

# Create unified agent (uses OpenAI o3 model)
agent = create_unified_agent("http://localhost:8051/sse")

# Single agent handles all workflows intelligently
async with agent.run_mcp_servers():
    # Research workflow - automatically detects URL and crawls
    result = await agent.run(
        "Crawl the Python documentation tutorial and then find examples of async/await patterns"
    )
    
    # Search workflow - automatically searches existing content  
    result = await agent.run(
        "Find information about FastAPI dependency injection"
    )
    
    # Code-focused workflow - automatically uses code search when appropriate
    result = await agent.run(
        "Show me code examples for FastAPI route handlers"
    )
```

### PostgreSQL 17 Setup

1. **Install PostgreSQL 17 and pgvector:**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install postgresql@17 pgvector

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install postgresql-17 postgresql-17-pgvector
   ```

2. **Start PostgreSQL and configure PATH:**
   ```bash
   # macOS - Start service
   brew services start postgresql@17

   # Add to PATH (add to your shell profile: ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@17/bin:$PATH"
   ```

3. **Create the database and run schema:**
   ```bash
   # Create database

- Tool selection and execution details
- OpenAI API calls with token usage and response times
- Error context and recovery attempts
- Performance metrics and bottleneck identification

### RAG Strategy Options

The Crawl4AI RAG MCP server supports four powerful RAG strategies that can be enabled independently:

#### 1. **USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS**
When enabled, this strategy enhances each chunk's embedding with additional context from the entire document. The system passes both the full document and the specific chunk to an LLM (configured via `MODEL_CHOICE`) to generate enriched context that gets embedded alongside the chunk content.

- **When to use**: Enable this when you need high-precision retrieval where context matters, such as technical documentation where terms might have different meanings in different sections.
- **Trade-offs**: Slower indexing due to LLM calls for each chunk, but significantly better retrieval accuracy.
- **Cost**: Additional LLM API calls during indexing.

#### 2. **USE_HYBRID_SEARCH**
Combines traditional keyword search with semantic vector search to provide more comprehensive results. The system performs both searches in parallel and intelligently merges results, prioritizing documents that appear in both result sets.

- **When to use**: Enable this when users might search using specific technical terms, function names, or when exact keyword matches are important alongside semantic understanding.
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly slower search queries but more robust results, especially for technical content.
- **Cost**: No additional API costs, just computational overhead.

#### 3. **USE_AGENTIC_RAG**
Enables specialized code example extraction and storage. When crawling documentation, the system identifies code blocks (≥300 characters), extracts them with surrounding context, generates summaries, and stores them in a separate vector database table specifically designed for code search.

- **When to use**: Essential for AI coding assistants that need to find specific code examples, implementation patterns, or usage examples from documentation.
- **Trade-offs**: Significantly slower crawling due to code extraction and summarization, requires more storage space.
- **Cost**: Additional LLM API calls for summarizing each code example.
- **Benefits**: Provides a dedicated `search_code_examples` tool that AI agents can use to find specific code implementations.

#### 4. **USE_RERANKING**
Applies cross-encoder reranking to search results after initial retrieval. Uses a lightweight cross-encoder model (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) to score each result against the original query, then reorders results by relevance.

- **When to use**: Enable this when search precision is critical and you need the most relevant results at the top. Particularly useful for complex queries where semantic similarity alone might not capture query intent.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds ~100-200ms to search queries depending on result count, but significantly improves result ordering.
- **Cost**: No additional API costs - uses a local model that runs on CPU.
- **Benefits**: Better result relevance, especially for complex queries. Works with both regular RAG search and code example search.

### Recommended Configurations

**For general documentation RAG:**
```
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=false
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=false
USE_RERANKING=true
```

**For AI coding assistant with code examples:**
```
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=true
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=true
USE_RERANKING=true
```

**For fast, basic RAG:**
```
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=false
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=false
USE_RERANKING=false
```

## Running the Server

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Fast startup with optimized script (90% faster)
./start_mcp_server.sh
```

### Manual Startup

```bash
# Activate environment and run
source crawl_venv/bin/activate
python src/crawl4ai_mcp.py
```

### Alternative with uv

```bash
uv run src/crawl4ai_mcp.py
```

The server will start and listen on the configured host and port (default: http://localhost:8051/sse).

## Using Pydantic AI Agents

Once the MCP server is running, you can use the Pydantic AI agents for intelligent workflows:

### Basic Agent Usage

```python
import asyncio
from pydantic_agent.unified_agent import create_unified_agent

async def main():
    # Create unified agent (handles all workflows)
    agent = create_unified_agent("http://localhost:8051/sse")

    # Single agent handles crawling and searching intelligently
    async with agent.run_mcp_servers():
        # Crawl and index content automatically
        crawl_result = await agent.run(
            "Crawl https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ and index all tutorial content"
        )
        
        # Search content with automatic tool selection
        search_result = await agent.run(
            "Find information about Python functions and provide examples"
        )

    print(f"Crawled: {crawl_result.data}")
    print(f"Found: {search_result.data}")

# Run the example
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Advanced Workflow Example

```python
from pydantic_agent.unified_agent import create_unified_agent

async def research_workflow():
    # Single agent orchestrates complex multi-step workflows
    agent = create_unified_agent()

    async with agent.run_mcp_servers():
        result = await agent.run(
            """
            Research FastAPI documentation:
            1. Crawl the main FastAPI docs
            2. Extract key concepts about dependency injection
            3. Find code examples for async endpoints
            4. Create a summary of best practices
            """
        )

    return result

# Run advanced workflow
result = asyncio.run(research_workflow())
```

## Integration with MCP Clients

### SSE Configuration

Once you have the server running with SSE transport, you can connect to it using this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawl4ai-rag": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:8051/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note for Windsurf users**: Use `serverUrl` instead of `url` in your configuration:
> ```json
> {
>   "mcpServers": {
>     "crawl4ai-rag": {
>       "transport": "sse",
>       "serverUrl": "http://localhost:8051/sse"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> **Note**: Make sure PostgreSQL 17 is running and accessible at `localhost:5432` before starting the server.

### Stdio Configuration

Add this server to your MCP configuration for Claude Desktop, Windsurf, or any other MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawl4ai-rag": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/crawl4ai-mcp/src/crawl4ai_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_api_key",
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://mg:@localhost:5432/crawl4ai_rag"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Alternative: Direct Python Execution

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawl4ai-rag": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "src/crawl4ai_mcp.py"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-crawl4ai-rag",
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_api_key",
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://mg:@localhost:5432/crawl4ai_rag"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Building Your Own Server and Agents

This implementation provides a foundation for building more complex MCP servers and intelligent agents with web crawling capabilities.

### Extending the MCP Server

To build your own MCP server:

1. Add your own tools by creating methods with the `@mcp.tool()` decorator
2. Create your own lifespan function to add your own dependencies
3. Modify the `utils.py` file for any helper functions you need
4. Extend the crawling capabilities by adding more specialized crawlers

### Creating Custom Unified Agents

To build your own unified Pydantic AI agents:

1. **Create Unified Agent Factory**:
   ```python
   def create_custom_unified_agent(server_url: str = "http://localhost:8051/sse") -> Agent:
       from mcp.client.sse import sse_client
       
       # Use OpenAI o3 for enhanced reasoning capabilities
       agent = Agent('openai:o3', mcp_servers=[sse_client(server_url)])

       @agent.tool
       async def custom_workflow_tool(ctx: RunContext, user_request: str) -> str:
           # Intelligent tool selection based on request analysis
           if "crawl" in user_request.lower() or "http" in user_request:
               # Trigger crawling workflow
               return await ctx.deps.smart_crawl_url(extract_url(user_request))
           elif "search" in user_request.lower():
               # Trigger search workflow  
               return await ctx.deps.perform_rag_query(extract_query(user_request))
           # Add more intelligent routing logic

       return agent
   ```

2. **Follow Unified Architecture Pattern**:
   ```python
   # Single agent that intelligently orchestrates multiple MCP tools
   # Based on natural language intent analysis
   # Uses OpenAI o3 for enhanced reasoning capabilities
   ```

3. **Create Structured Outputs**:
   ```python
   class UnifiedResult(BaseModel):
       workflow_type: str  # "research", "search", "discovery"
       tools_used: List[str]  # MCP tools that were called
       success: bool
       data: Any
       metadata: Dict[str, Any]
   ```

4. **Follow Integration Patterns**: Use official MCP Python SDK patterns with `agent.run_mcp_servers()` context manager
