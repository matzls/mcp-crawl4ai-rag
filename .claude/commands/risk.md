# Risk Assessment
Analyze risks for $ARGUMENTS.

## Steps
1. **Think hard** about failure points and unknowns
2. **Use subagent** to investigate technical uncertainties
3. **Categorize risks:** Integration (ðŸ”´) > Technical (ðŸŸ¡) > Business (ðŸŸ¢)
4. **Prioritize by impact + likelihood**
5. **Update Current Tasks** with risk-prioritized order
6. **Document findings** in Project Architecture

Focus: What could make this fail? What are we most unsure about?
